Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage. With the abundance of data, I am to build a set of data reports to get answers to some of the questions CitiBike often gets asked. Where do Citi Bikers ride? When do they ride? How far do they go? Which stations are most popular? What days of the week are most rides taken on? These are the questions that CitiBike might want to answer to improve their business. This website presents the results of my exploration of CitiBike data for Jersey City.

## Steps

1. Aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs.
2. Answer the following questions with collected data:

* How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?

* By what percentage has total ridership grown? 

* How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months? 

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey?

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)

* Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?

* How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan?

* How does the average trip duration change by age?

* What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?

* Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan? 

* How variable is the utilization by bike ID?


3. Plot a static map that shows all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.

4. Build a Tableau Dashboard that can be used by and clear to city officials, public administrators, and heads of New Jersey City departments. Present data and analysis in a way that is focused, concise, easy-to-understand, and visually compelling.
